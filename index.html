            <h2>Entering answers</h2>
            <p>
                In the answers field, for numerical and function answers, you can enter various expressions 
                as part of your answer.
                The input field can function like a mini-calculator. In fact, it is recommended to
                type in the exact answer (in terms of \(\cos, \sin, e, \pi, \text{etc.}\)) if your answer 
                is not an integer. The precision used your answer is checked to is greater than
                that of most calculators.
            </p>
            <p>
                The functions you may use can be found here: 
                <a href="https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html">functions</a>, 
                <a href="https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/constants.html">constants</a>.
                Not all of these will work in the input field, but simple elemetary functions 
                and common constants should work. To use \(\pi\) for example, simply type
                <span class="mono">pi</span>. To calculate \(\cos(1)\), simply enter
                <span class="mono">cos(1)</span>. Note that all trigonometric and 
                hyperbolic functions use radians as both of their input and output units.
            </p>
            <p>The following manually added / renamed functions are also available:
                <ul class="mono">
                    <li>arcsin(x)</li>
                    <li>arccos(x)</li>
                    <li>arctan(x)</li>
                    <li>arcsinh(x)</li>
                    <li>arccosh(x)</li>
                    <li>arctanh(x)</li>
                    <li>ln(x)</li>
                    <li>nCr(n,r)</li>
                    <li>nPr(n,r)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you use undefined constants or functions, it may not error
                until you submit your answers at the end, which is when 
                answers are checked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also note that it is your responsibility to determine whether the answer
                should be a numerical value or a function when such information not explicitly specified.
                The questions give you enough information to discern whether the answer
                is in terms of constants and variables from the question, or whether it is
                a numerical value.
            </p>
            <h2>Submitting answers</h2>
            <p>
                Apart from the tutorial questions, your answers will not be checked as
                you type them. This is to prevent brute-forcing the answer to each
                individual question. Moreover, the system is designed so that it can only
                tell if <it>all</it> the answers are correct. It is physically impossible
                to check individual answers by looking at the source code. Thus, you will
                not know which question is incorrect until you get them all right.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if there is an error evaluating a certain answer you inputted,
                then you will be told which question that was so you can correct it.
